My partner, Shakira Perry, and I, Bailey Watson have created a website for the local business, Tail Wagger'z. Tail Wagger's is a local all natural food store in Jackson, TN. We both strive to become more advanced in building a website and wish to go even further.

Our Website was created to allow people to keep up with the store, read what Tail Wagger'z is all about and keep up with current events. Our website contains the information that would typically be searched for by a potential customer.
